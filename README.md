💻 Laptop Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts **laptop prices** based on their specifications such as brand, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage type, screen resolution, and more.  
Built using Python and Scikit-learn, this project demonstrates **end-to-end ML workflow** — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and deployment.

🚀 Features
- 📊 Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**
- 🧠 Machine Learning model training using **Scikit-learn**
- 🔍 Feature engineering with **OneHotEncoding** and **Pipeline**
- 🌐 Streamlit-based web app for interactive price prediction
- 💾 Model serialization using **Pickle**
